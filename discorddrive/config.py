"""Configuration handling.

Windows: config in %APPDATA%\\DiscordDrive\\config.json, data (index, caches) in
%LOCALAPPDATA%\\DiscordDrive.
Linux:   config in ~/.config/DiscordDrive/config.json, data in ~/.local/share/DiscordDrive.

Nothing is ever read from the current directory or the source checkout, so the
bot token and encryption key never end up inside a git repository or synced folder.

The secrets in the file (SECRET_FIELDS) are not stored readable: they are kept together in one
entry, "protected", encrypted for this computer and account (see secretbox.py). A file written by
hand or by an older version, with the secrets in the clear, is accepted; it is rewritten protected
when the drive starts (Config.protect_file), not by other commands: an older version of the drive
that is still running would not understand the new form and could lose the secrets.

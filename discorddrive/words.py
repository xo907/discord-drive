"""The recovery phrase: the drive's 256-bit encryption key written as 24 ordinary words.

It is the BIP39 way of writing 256 bits (the standard English list of 2048 words, 11 bits a word,
the last word carrying an 8-bit checksum that catches a mistyped or misplaced word), so password
managers and people who know seed phrases recognise it. The phrase *is* the key: whoever has it can
read the drive, and nothing else is needed to set up a new device or to sign in to the dashboard.

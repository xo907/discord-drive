"""Sync and backup folders: keep a folder on this computer and a folder on the drive in step,
e.g. C:\\Users\\me\\Downloads -> Z:\\Downloads.

Each job pairs a local folder with a drive folder and has a *mode* (what is copied which way) and a
*trigger* (when it runs). Jobs belong to this device (they name local folders), so they are kept in
its config file (`sync_jobs`); what they copy onto the drive syncs to every device as usual.

Modes
    backup           this computer -> drive. New and changed files are copied; files deleted here
                     stay on the drive.
    mirror           this computer -> drive, exactly: deleting a file here deletes it on the drive
                     too (the drive keeps it under Deleted, so it can be brought back).
    two-way          both ways. Changes and deletions on either side are copied to the other. A file
                     changed on both sides since the last sync is kept twice (" (conflict ...)").
    move             this computer -> drive, then the file is deleted here once it is safely stored
                     in Discord (frees space, e.g. for Downloads).
    download         drive -> this computer. New and changed files are copied; files deleted on the
                     drive stay here.
    download-mirror  drive -> this computer, exactly. Files deleted on the drive are moved to a
                     holding folder here (kept 30 days), never deleted outright.

Triggers
    live      as soon as something changes (Windows tells us at once; elsewhere, and for changes on
              the drive, the folders are checked every few seconds), plus a full check now and then.
    interval  every N minutes.
    daily     once a day at HH:MM.
    manual    only when started (dashboard, menu, or `sync run`).

Files are compared by size and modification time; copies keep the original modification time, so
nothing is copied twice. A file still being written (changed in the last few seconds, or locked by
the program writing it) waits for the next pass, and partial downloads (*.crdownload, *.part, ...)
are never copied. Runs inside the drive process; the command line and the dashboard change the
config and leave requests in <data dir>/sync, and read the status the drive writes there.
